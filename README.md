Hello! This is a project I made that involves the use of many data strucutres such as priority queues and hash maps.
This is a simulation of a race from Mario Kart. We use a binary min heap priority queue to track the racers and their
positions relative to the finish line, updating at interval (each second). Remove the racer from the priority queue
if they have reached a certain priority value as this indicates that they have crossed the line. Manually implemented
the logic for bubbleUp and bubbleDown to simulate the insertion and the deletion of racers from the race.
